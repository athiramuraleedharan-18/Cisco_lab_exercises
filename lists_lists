#List comprehensions
'''
List comprehension is actually a list, but created on-the-fly during
program execution, and is not described statically.

row=['WHITE PAWN' for i in range(8)]

print(row)

#squares
squares=[x**2 for x in range(11)]
print(squares)


#twos
twos=[2**i for i in range(11)]
print(twos)

#odd elements of the squares list
odds=[x for x in squares if x%2!=0]
print(odds)

#Two dimmensional arrays
#lists of lists
board=[]
for i in range(8):
  row=['EMPTY' for i in range(8)]
  board.append(row)
print(board)

#As list comprehensions can be nested , the board creation can be shortened:
board=[['EMPTY' for i in range(8)] for j in range(8)]
#The inner part creates a row, and the outer part builds a list of rows.

#3d list
rooms=[[[False for r in range(20)]for f in range(15)]for t in range(3)]
print(rooms)
